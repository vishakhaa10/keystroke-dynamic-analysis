# keystroke-dynamic-analysis

Keystroke dynamics basically deals with the analysis of keystroke patterns of a user. In one of its use cases, this can essentially enable companies to provide non-intrusive real-time authentication of users.

By capturing the duration between 2 key presses, the duration of pressing down a key, and the duration between the current key release and the next key press can provide great insights about the user. The next time this user logs in, by comparing his current typing pattern with his previous typing patterns, companies can authenticate whether the logged in user is legitimate or fraudulent.

This dataset captures typing attempts of 110 users. Each user has attempted 8 times to type the string 'united states' and the corresponding timestamps of key press and release relative to the first key press have been captured.
